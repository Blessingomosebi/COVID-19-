# COVID 19 
 Excited to share my latest project as a Power BI Intern at InternCareer diving into COVID-19 data analysis! 📊  In this task, I took charge of cleaning the dataset, ensuring accuracy by eliminating errors. Leveraging Power BI, I crafted compelling visualizations showcasing trends in confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and testing. 📈  But that's not all! 🗺️ I also delved into the geographical spread of COVID-19 cases, mapping out the impact across regions.  Thrilled to be part of a team making a difference through data! 🌐💼 hashtag#PowerBI hashtag#DataAnalysis hashtag#InternshipJourney hashtag#COVID19Insights
